# Meseum Inclusive UX Design

**--> WARNING: material is being updated and documentation is not complete <---**

A modular approach to assess and design museum or exhibitions inclusivity (with the ambition of one day being able to get around to removing the word "inclusive").

## Tool: the Inclusive Exhibition Map
The  canvas is designed to facilitate the design and analysis of user experience in museum settings. This tool helps designers map the interactions between the user and the service, identifying key moments, interactions, modularity, and assessing the inclusiveness, accessibility, diversity, and equity of the experience offered.

Use as a series of smaller activities with partial templates.

### Objectives
- Articulate situations into scenes and moments for detailed understanding.
- Analyze user-service interactions in terms of performance and satisfaction.
- Identify add-ons to meet specific needs of different users.
- Evaluate the experience in terms of inclusiveness, accessibility, diversity, and equity.

### Intended Use
This canvas is an essential resource for designers, museum managers, and UX professionals who aim to create engaging and accessible museum experiences for all. It is ideal for planning new exhibits, revising existing experiences, or as a teaching tool for professional development.

### Workshop materials: experiencing misalignment

Together with the map, it is possible to build workshop activities for different audiences, through more technical tools (proper to service or interaction design, for example), but also more properly cultural ones.

One example is this approach that seeks to introduce audiences unfamiliar with inclusion issues to the concept of empathy, which is fundamental to approaching the design of effective experiences.
The proposed activity insists on the idea of misalignment between body and social context, evoking in participants the emotions that marked the moments when they had that feeling. The underlying idea is to make people understand that this misalignment (the heart of the WHO definition of disability), is a condition that affects everyone, not just people with disabilities, and can be both contextual and temporary in nature.

## Other tools coming soon
The Inclusive Exhibition Map is different from a typical journey map, as it's positioned in between the classic journey mapping approach and strategy, focusing on a wider multi-user system of requirements and interactions. For this reason, a number of other tools will be used to support institutions in adopting a full-stack inclusive design methodology.
